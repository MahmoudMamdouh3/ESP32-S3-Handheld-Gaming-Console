  - `core/host_bench.py`: Quantitative microbenchmark suite for BmoFace SDF math, 4-pixel coalesced stores, and opcode dispatch.
  - `core/cppcheck_runner.py`: Cppcheck static analyzer integration for embedded memory safety.
  - `core/report_gen.py`: Ground-truth Markdown & JSON audit report generator.
  - `cli.py`: Unified command line interface (`python -m tools.guardian audit`, `bus-calc`, `profile-elf`, `bench-host`, `report`).
  - `tests/test_guardian.py`: Complete test suite for Guardian framework (5 unit tests).
- **Firmware Hardware Cycle Profiler Subsystem (`profiler.h` / `profiler.cpp`)**:

---

## [Milestone 8.0] - 2026-08-31 (Production-Grade Testing Overhaul & Flash Overflow Fix)
### Fixed
- **Flash Overflow Root Cause**: The `158% of storage space` error is caused by the Arduino IDE defaulting to the 3 MB partition scheme. Fix: **Tools → Partition Scheme → Custom**. Firmware compiles at 5,002,020 bytes = **29.8% of 16MB** (VERIFIED_HOST, arduino-cli exit 0, this session).
- **Stub Engines Honestly Labeled**: 9 of 14 emulator vendor engines (`pce`, `stella`, `pico`, `genesis`, `snes`, `wswan`, `ngp`, `lynx`, `colem`) were scaffold stubs rendering a blank framebuffer with no CPU emulation. All 9 now carry `// STUB_ENGINE` sentinel comments and are tagged `"engine_status": "stub"` in `AGENT_MANIFEST.json`.
- **False VERIFIED_HOST Claims Corrected**: All prior Tier 1/2 `VERIFIED_HOST` claims reclassified as `FIXED_UNVERIFIED`. The Python test suite was checking file existence — not running `arduino-cli compile`.

### Added
- **Production CI Validator — 7 Phases** (`scripts/validate_repo.py`): Phase 0 runs real `arduino-cli compile` with flash/SRAM budget reporting. Phase 2 checks all 14 teardowns, Serial.print ban, partition overlaps. Phase 4 validates structural soundness and `engine_status` fields.
- **32 Unit Tests** (was 27): Added test_08 (STUB_ENGINE sentinel), test_09 (partition math), test_10 (no Serial.print), test_11 (manifest count vs filesystem), test_12 (config hard-stop exact values). All 32 pass.

Added Flash `.rodata` protection guards in `SDCard::freeRom()`. Compiled binary size is 4,986,092 bytes (59.44% of 8MB `app0` partition), retaining 3,402,516 bytes of headroom.
- **Software Design Document (SDD) v3.0**: Upgraded [`docs/software-design-document.md`](file:///e:/BMO%20Gameboy/docs/software-design-document.md) to a comprehensive living architectural specification suitable for autonomous agents and external reviewers without filesystem access. Includes complete hardware matrix, memory topologies, 2D SDF mascot mathematics, N3 SPI streaming protocol, and dual-ROM fallback contracts.
- **Rule 32 (Modular Core Template)**: Created [`.agents/rules/32_modular_core_template.md`](file:///e:/BMO%20Gameboy/.agents/rules/32_modular_core_template.md) with copy-paste templates and 6-step checklist for frictionless emulator and subsystem additions.
- **Rule 33 (Agent Handoff & Optimization Cycle)**: Created [`.agents/rules/33_agent_handoff_and_optimization_cycle.md`](file:///e:/BMO%20Gameboy/.agents/rules/33_agent_handoff_and_optimization_cycle.md) establishing continuous optimization and status tagging across sequential AI sessions.
- **Rule 34 (AI Agent Sandbox & Guardrails)**: Created [`.agents/rules/34_ai_agent_sandbox_and_guardrails.md`](file:///e:/BMO%20Gameboy/.agents/rules/34_ai_agent_sandbox_and_guardrails.md) establishing strict invariants for LLMs (hardware safety, anti-hallucination, memory alignment, and teardown lifecycle).
